Notes

* 
* input('can put prompt here')
* try: except: catches errors
* 'in' keyword in case of string  
* All the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters. -> conver to standard
* Strings are immutable
* Lists are mutable
* Don't forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None. 
    This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.
* To remove an element from a list, you can use pop, remove, del
* To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:

* [] a list (mutable)
* {} a dictionary
* ()/ ,  a tuple (immutable)
